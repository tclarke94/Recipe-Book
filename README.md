# Recipe-Book

  Recipe Book is a simple digital recipe rolodex that consists of recipes from a collaborative cookbook my parnter and I share. It's a living document that inspires and envigorates, with the overall goal being to pass the recipes down to my daughter, Vera.

Technologies Used : HTML, EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, ExpressJS, Bootstrap
  
  Goals for the user were to produce a clean, simple and intuitive layout to interact with. To be able to create, add, edit, delete and view the recipes. To have redirect buttons so as to change pages without having to edit or add a recipe.

  I struggled with a few of the routes, edit in particular, but I was able to overcome my problems by attending office hours. I learned a good amount of debugging skills such as commenting out each of my routes and uncommenting them one by one to find where the bug is hiding. Bootstrap was also a bit more challenging than I had anticipated so I ended up doing some in-line CSS to get the project looking how I wanted.
  
  One of the bigger upgrades I contemplated but didn't follow through on was having the edit route redirect to the ID of which had been editted. Currently it takes you back to the index page post edit; Eric enlightened me on the process to return to a specific ID, it would involve creating a new variable and few other steps that escape me at the moment.
I also had the stretch goal of creating a calendar for meal planning, as well as a rating system to know which recipe we like best.
